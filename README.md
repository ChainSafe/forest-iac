# ðŸŒ² Forest IaC

This repository contains machine-readable specifications for the auxillilary services that [Forest](https://github.com/ChainSafe/forest) project running smoothly. The services include daily uploads of network snapshots, and automated testing of Forest's capabilities.

# ðŸ”§ Desired properties

 - Fault tolerant.
 - Use a consistent strategy for uploading/storing logs and reporting errors.
