# ðŸŒ² Forest IaC

This repository contains machine-readable specifications for the auxillilary services that [Forest](https://github.com/ChainSafe/forest) project running smoothly. The services include daily uploads of network snapshots, and automated testing of Forest's capabilities.

# ðŸ”§ Desired properties

 - Require minimal setup. Ideally any server with [docker](https://www.docker.com/) installed should be sufficient.
 - Automatic and error-proof re-deployment when new infrastructure code is available.
 - Runs without human intervention. The services should stay running unless explicitly stopped.
 - Fault tolerant.
 - Use a consistent strategy for uploading/storing logs and reporting errors.
 - Is idempotent. Multiple instances can run without adverse effect.
 - Is sanity checked. Shell scripts with `shellcheck`, Ruby scripts with `RuboCop`, Rust with `clippy`.

# âš¡ Services

- [x] Daily calibnet snapshots.
- [x] Sync testing for Forest docker image.
- [ ] Exhaustive RPC testing for Forest docker image.
- [ ] Sync testing for PRs.
- [ ] Export testing for PRs.

## Running Forest In DigitalOcean

## Architectural Implementation

![Untitled Diagram drawio (8)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47984109/215227510-dac5b8fb-8019-4388-a0e7-d5c432b95d70.png)

The flow goes from Terraform for provisioning of the servers and Anisble to run all neccessary installations including forest.

## Requirements 
- RAM: 32GB
- VCPU: 8
- Startup Disk Size: 100 GB
- Expected Total Disk Size: >500 GB

N/B: It's worth to note that some of the naming conventions can be changed to suit your deployment needs. 

To test out the implementation, just access the server with appropiate `ssh` details in this manner `ssh -i ~/id_rsa chainsafe@ip_address`.
